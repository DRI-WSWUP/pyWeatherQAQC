pyWeatherQAQC - Graphical Weather Data Correction
=================================================

Flexible, command-line-driven software to QC daily weather data and then calculate reference evapotranspiration.
This software was developed to achieve following goals:

* Allow users to configure this software to fit their data.
* Graphically plot data trends over time for visual inspection.
* Provide users with flexible options to QC data in a manual to semi-automated fashion.
* Allow for multiple iterations of corrections, as well as provide an opportunity to undo mistakes.
* Increase accountability in QC of data by making log files and before/after graphs.
* Output data with standardized units and file format, facilitating downstream data applications.

-----------------------------------------------------------

The pyWeatherQAQC workflow can be broken down into several basic steps:

1. The user edits a config file detailing what variables are in what columns of the data files
   they want to QC, as well as metadata about the weather station.
2. The software makes an initial run, during which the software generates plots of the data but does not
   change any initial data values.
3. The user visually inspects plots of data to determine what sections require QC or removal.
4. The software makes a second run, during which the user QC's the data through guided prompts.
5. The process is considered complete, and the user repeats this process with the next station.

If the scope of work is limited to more than just a few stations, it is time-efficient to set up a metadata file for
all stations that will be QC'd. See :doc:`Data Preparation <data_preparation>' for more info.

.. note::
   pyWeatherQAQC was developed for daily weather data. Support for hourly data is within the eventual scope of this
   project but is currently not available.
