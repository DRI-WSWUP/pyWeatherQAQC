Correction Methods
##################

This page contains details on the correction methods used by pyWeatherQAQC. The methods chosen could be summed up as:

**Make as few changes as possible to fix bad trends in data without sacrificing the real measured qualities of that data.**

Limits on Data
==============
The following limits are used when reading in the data to determine any unreasonable values, which are then removed.

* -50 C <= Temperature <= 60 C
* 0 m/s < Wind Speed <= 35 m/s
* 0 mm <= Precipitation <= 610 mm
* 5 w/m2 <= Solar Radiation <= 700 w/m2
* 0 kPa <= Vapor Pressure <= 8 kPa  #
* 2% < Relative Humidity < 110%

The number of points from each variable removed by these limits are saved in the log file.

Temperature Correction
======================
Temperature correction is done by removing outliers using a modified z-score approach based on median absolute deviation as described in::

  "Boris Iglewicz and David Hoaglin (1993)
   Volume 16: How to Detect and Handle Outliers,
   The ASQC Basic References in Quality Control: Statistical Techniques"

The process occurs in the following steps:

1. Temperature values are divided into subgroups based on what month they occur in.
2. Each group (twelve total groups) of temperature values has its median absolute deviation calculated.
3. That median absolute deviation is used to calculate a z-score for every temperature value within the group.
4. Any value that exceeds the z-score threshold of 3.5 is removed as a likely outlier. The threshold of 3.5 is recommended by Iglewicz and Hoaglin.
5. The data, once free of outliers, is considered corrected.

Generally, temperature data suffers from discrete outliers introduced from equipment malfunctions rather than chronic problems like sensor drift.
Checking for outliers with an outlier-resistant method such as this allows for the removal of those outliers without modifying the rest of
the data.

Wind and Precipitation
======================

There are no easy, reliable ways for us to infer what reasonable wind or precipitation data should be when presented with bad values,
such as suspiciously high amounts of rainfall or wind data that remains constant over time. For these variables it is recommended to
just throw remove bad or suspect values.

Relative Humidity Max/Min Correction
====================================
Relative humidity correction is done through a year-based percentile approach, broken down into these steps:

1. Divide the entire record into periods based on calendar years (365-366 values per year).
2. Remove all nans from within each calendar year.
3. Find the top 1% RHMax values within each calendar year once NaNs have been removed by dividing the number of non-nan
   days by 100, rounding down, but with a minimum of one, and finding that many largest values (3 for a full year). This
   division of the year by 100 is to prevent years at the start and end of record that may not have a full year from being oversampled.
4. Take the average of those values.
5. Calculate the ratio of 100 and that RHMax average.
6. Multiply every RHMax value within each calendar year with its corresponding 100/RHMax average.
7. Multiply every RHMin value within each calendar year with its corresponding 100/RHMax average.
8. If any points of RHMax or RHMin are greater than 100% post correction, those points are set to equal 100. If any
   points of RHMax or RHMin are less than 0% post correction,  those points are set equal to 0.
   If RHMax is less than RHMin ( as an error in initial dataset), that RHMax and Min are thrown out.
9. The data is now considered corrected.

One of the most common problems with RH data is sensor drift that occurs slowly over time. This pattern is visible
in the test_data.csv dataset that is provided in the repository. A year-based percentile approach allows for
steadily-increasing correction factors over time to fix this, and making the periods of correction years will ideally
make each period have all four seasons, which is important in arid locations or other places with seasonal rainfall.

.. caution::
   This method assumes daily RH values that have been calculated from subdaily RH values. If RH is computed from
   measured dewpoint temperature then this method is not reliable. However, if dewpoint temperature is provided
   and directly measured, using dewpoint data is preferable to using relative humidity data.

Vapor Pressure and RH Average
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As with wind and precipitation data, there are no easy, reliable ways for us to infer what vapor pressure or average relative humidity should
be when presented with bad values, for these variables it is recommended to just throw remove bad or suspect values, or instead choose
to use a variable like RH Max/Min and Dewpoint Temperature than you can QC.

Solar Radiation Correction
==========================
Correcting solar radiation data is done through a period-based percentile correction, which occurs in the following steps:

1. Divide the entire record into 60 day periods.
2. Find the number of ratios of Rs/Rso for each 60 day period that are above one (signifying measured Rs is above Rso).
3. Check the number of points that are above one in each 60 day period.
4. If it is only one or two, remove those two points for Rs and set them to 1.05 * Rso. Go to step 6.
5. If it is either zero, or three (5% of the period) or more, do nothing. Go to step 6.
6. Once that is done, try to find the top six (10% of the period) ratios of rs/rso for each 60 day period.
7. If you can find those all those values, go to step 9.
8. If you cannot find 6 non-NaN values, throw out all datapoints in the period as there is insufficient data to make a correction.
   The number of data points removed by this process is tracked in the log file. Go to step 9.
9. Find the corresponding six Rs and Rso values for those six ratios.
10. Take the average of those six Rs data points and the average of those six Rso data points.
11. Divide this new average Rso value with this new average Rs value to get a final ratio.
12. Check the value of this final Rso_avg/Rs_avg ratio.
13. If the ratio is between 0.97-1.03, do nothing, as the data is considered "real." Go to step 16.
14. If the ratio is below 0.50 or above 1.50, throw out all data within that period. Go to step 16.
15. Multiply every Rs value within the 60 day period by that Rso_avg/Rs_avg ratio to correct the data.
16. Any Rs values that have been corrected to be larger than their corresponding Rso are set to equal Rso.
    The number of points modified in this manner is tracked in the log file.
17. The data is now considered corrected.

Rs correction is dependant on Rso values, which itself is dependant on humidity data. We recommend Rs is corrected last
so that we can use the best-possible Rso for the correction process.

Solar radiation is more likely to have problems than other weather data, and will frequently have voltage spikes and sensor drift
occurring together. This period-based percentile approach that tracks the number of times measured solar radiation exceeds theoretical clear-sky
solar radiation allows for the correction of progressive sensor drift while at the same time catching voltage spikes during the period.
The limit of 3 observations in each 60-day period is to account for stations where Rs constantly exceeds Rso, either due to
poor calibration or some natural factor like additional reflected solar radiation from objects like clouds.
