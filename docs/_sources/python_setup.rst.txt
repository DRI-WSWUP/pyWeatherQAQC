Installing Python
#################

If you're unfamiliar with Python, it's recommended that you install Anaconda.

Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of Python that, in exchange for a larger download, will simplify your setup experience. It also comes pre-installed with the majority of the package requirements for pyWeatherQAQC.

Visit the `Anaconda website <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`_ to download the correct Anaconda 3.X version for your operating system, and then follow the prompts to install it.

**Important: make sure you're installing the 3.X version of Anaconda!**

Once you're done installing Anaconda, open the command prompt or terminal window and type::

    >conda info

You should see some text regarding the version of Anaconda you've installed. If you get an error, you may have made a mistake during the installation.

Using an Environment
====================

One of the best features of Anaconda is the ease of setting up an environment, which is a dedicated space where you can setup and run code without having to worry about version and installation conflicts with any other code you may have to run.

If you're doing any other work with Python code, it's recommended you take the extra steps to set this up now and save yourself a potential headache later one.

**To create an environment, type**::

    >conda create -n pyweatherqaqc python=3.7 anaconda

**Once that is done, activate your environment by typing**::

    >activate pyweatherqaqc


.. note::
   You will have to activate your environment whenever you close and reopen the command prompt/terminal window.

**Now**, see :doc:`pyWeatherQAQC Setup <qaqc_setup>` to get started!
