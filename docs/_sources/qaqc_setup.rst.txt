Downloading the Code
====================

This script is self-contained and is run locally, so the directory can be placed wherever you want it.

You will run the code by directing the command prompt or terminal window to the location of the file **QAQC_Master.py** and running it from there.

Download pyWeatherQAQC by cloning its `Github Repository <https://github.com/WSWUP/pyWeatherQAQC>`_ or by `clicking here. <https://github.com/WSWUP/pyWeatherQAQC/archive/master.zip>`_


Installing Dependencies
=======================
.. note::
   If you're using an Anaconda environment, make sure it is set up and activated before proceeding.

Once you've downloaded the code and directed the command prompt/terminal window to the directory containing the file **QAQC_Master.py**, type::

   >pip install -r requirements.txt

This will check for and install all missing dependencies that pyWeatherQAQC needs to run.

**Next**, see :doc:`Setting up the Data <data_setup>` to configure the script to handle your data.
