pyWeatherQAQC Setup
###################

This page details the process for installing pyWeatherQAQC. This excludes the process for configuring and
then processing data, which is detailed in :doc:`Data Preparation. <data_preparation>`

Installing Python
=================

If you're unfamiliar with Python, it's recommended that you install Anaconda.

Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of Python that, in exchange for a larger download, will simplify your setup experience. It also comes pre-installed with the majority of the package requirements for pyWeatherQAQC.

Visit the `Anaconda website <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`_ to download the correct Anaconda 3.X version for your operating system, and then follow the prompts to install it.

Once you're done installing Anaconda, open the command prompt or terminal window and type::

    >conda info

You should see some text regarding the version of Anaconda you've installed. If you get an error, you may have made a mistake during the installation.

Using an Environment
====================

One of the best features of Anaconda is the ease of setting up an environment, which is a dedicated space where you can setup and run code without having to worry about version and installation conflicts with any other software you may have to run.

If you're doing any other work with Python code, it's recommended to take the extra steps to set this up and avoid potential issues later on.

**To create an environment, type**::

    >conda create -n pyweatherqaqc python=3.7 anaconda

**Once that is done, activate your environment by typing**::

    >activate pyweatherqaqc

.. note::
   You will have to activate your environment whenever you close the command prompt/terminal window.

Downloading the Repository
==========================

This script is self-contained and is run locally, so the directory can be placed wherever you want it.

You will run the code by directing the command prompt or terminal window to the location of the file **qaqc_single_station.py** and running it from there.

Download pyWeatherQAQC by cloning its `Github Repository <https://github.com/WSWUP/pyWeatherQAQC>`_ or by `clicking here. <https://github.com/WSWUP/pyWeatherQAQC/archive/master.zip>`_


Installing Dependencies
=======================
.. note::
   If you're using an Anaconda environment, make sure it is activated before proceeding.

Once the repository has been downloaded and the command prompt/terminal window is located in the directory
containing the file **qaqc_single_station.py**, type::

   >pip install -r requirements.txt

This will check for and install all missing dependencies that pyWeatherQAQC needs to run.
