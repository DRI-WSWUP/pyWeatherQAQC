Stuck, lost, or confused? Here are some tips:

    * Ultimately, the original data file is never altered, so you're free to experiment with options to see how it affects the data.
    * If you set up a dedicated python environment for the script, are you currently in that environment?
    * If you're experiencing an error that is causing the script to crash, it is most likely due to an incorrect setup in your data and .ini files. Is there a random "DATA END" string at the end of your file? Are your columns and units properly identified?
    * If you're confused on what method to use or value to select, each prompt has a recommendation on what to do. Look for either the option marked (Recommended) or the value suggested by the prompt for a guide.
    * Each time you correct a variable, you're given the option to do another iteration, start over, or exit without saving your corrections, so if you make a mistake you're able to fix it.
    * If you come across data that you feel is so bad it's past the point of correction, just select an interval around those values and throw them out.
    * The only correction precipitation or wind speed should ever need is the removal of bad values.
