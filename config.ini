# Mode Configuration Settings
# This section decides which options the script will use when it is run.
# Each option is explained in more detail below

##########
# Script Mode - This option decides if the file is going to be corrected or if it is just going to plot of the data.
#	Set this to 0 to just plot the data.
#	Set this to 1 to correct the data.
# 	Consult the README.md for more information.
script_mode = 1

##########
# "Auto" Correction - This option causes the script to do each selected variable's first correction automatically
# This will save you some work if the data is good, but may cause you more work if the data is poor.
#	Set this to 0 to do everything manually.
#	Set this to 1 to have the first pass be automatic (but with a chance to review).
auto_mode = 1

##########
# Filling Mode - This option determines whether or not missing data will be filled in by the script to finish correction
# with a full record of ETr and ETo.
#	Set this to 0 to not fill data
#	Set this to 1 to fill data
fill_mode = 0

##########
# Plotting Mode - This option determines whether or not bokeh plots will be generated.
#	Set this to 0 to not generate bokeh plots
#	Set this to 1 to generate bokeh plots

[DATA]
########################################################################################################################
# Data Organization Section
# 
# In this section you will specify which columns the data are located in, as well as what units they are provided in.
# 
# Important information:
# 	Indexes start at 0, so the variable in column A (if using excel) is at index 0, column B is at index 1, and so on.
#	If a variable is not provided by the station, set the <var>_col variable to -1.
#	All unit flag variables must be set to either 0 (False) or 1 (True).
#	Please ensure that only one unit flag per variable is set to 1 (True).
#	Each variable will specify below what units it defaults to if no unit flag is provided.
