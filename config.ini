# Configuration file for pyWeatherQAQC 
#
# The python script QAQC_Master.py automatically opens this file and reads the parameters here when you run it.
#
# The purpose of this configuration file is to specify:
#	1.	The metadata weather station and data file that you are processing
#	2.	The organization of weather data variables within the data file
#	3.	Which script options the user would like to enable or disable

# Mode Configuration Settings
# This section decides which options the script will use when it is run.
# Each option is explained in more detail below

##########
# Script Mode - This option decides if the file is going to be corrected or if it is just going to generate a plot of the data.
#	Set this to 0 to just plot the data.
#	Set this to 1 to correct the data.
# 	Consult the README.md for more information.

[DATA]
########################################################################################################################
# Data Organization Section
# 
# In this section you will specify which columns the data are located in, as well as what units they are provided in.
# 
# Important information:
# 	Indexes start at 0, so the variable in column A (if looking at it in excel) is at index 0, column B is at index 1, and so on. 
#	If a variable is not provided by the station, set the <var>_col variable to -1.
#	All unit flag variables must be set to either 0 (False) or 1 (True).
#	Please ensure that only one unit flag per variable is set to 1 (True).
#	Each variable will specify below what units it defaults to if no unit flag is provided.

####################
# Date Configuration:
# The script can handle both a string date (MM/DD/YYYY) or seperate month, day, and year columns. You need to specify what format the date is in.
